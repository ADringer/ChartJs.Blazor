### Describe your question
A clear and concise description of what you want to know.

### Which Blazor project type is your question related to?
<!-- Remove the items which don't apply from the following list -->
- Client-Side
- Server-Side

### Which charts is this question related to?
<!-- Please list the charts this question applies to. If it applies to all of them, just write 'all charts'. -->

### JavaScript equivalent
<!--
    If the question is "how can I do x?", then please include how you can do it with JavaScript by
    adding a link to a [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) and pasting the code here.
    This library just acts as a bridge between Blazor (C#) and Chart.js (JavaScript) and we don't
    have the time to help you with questions that only relate to Chart.js and not this library.
    Thank you for your understanding.

    Only if you're 100% certain that it doesn't make sense to include JavaScript code, remove this section.
