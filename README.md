# Introduction

This library is a modification of [this awesome library](https://github.com/mariusmuntean/ChartJs.Blazor). 
I intend to extend the functionality (mainly of the LineChart), fix issues and add more options from Chart.js (completeness).  

I fully intend giving all of this back to the community so that the original repository also gets all of these changes. Sadly because it's not a simple fork I don't know how to do that directly (let me know if you can help me with that :).
