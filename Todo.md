- maybe wrap string-color
- separate data (maybe interface so every XY.. is a Data), same with Options and Datasets -> should enable more generic possibilities so the charts, datas, datasets - etc aren't linked as hard together as they're now
- check the summaries of the axis when Data etc are separated
- fucking aues mau testä (samples machä)
- axes etc -> namespaces
- rästlächi axes drzuä tuä
- remake point styles
- find out why currently nothing is showing (compare json output from old version with new version)
- check why Round property of TimeOptions isnt working correctly
- add static DefaultFormat dict (https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/axes/cartesian/time.html#display-formats)
- add static de-ch dict (or find a way to generate/get it without manually specifying everything)
